## Popular Movies App

Second project for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app, optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. Movies launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. Movies fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.
